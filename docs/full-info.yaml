# This file contains the FULL specification for the info.yaml file which defines all the challenge data for CTFd.
# NOTE: You should NOT just copy and paste this file into your challenge as it defines a lot of extra fields you probably don't want.
#       If you want a file for a good baseline check out info.yaml

# Required sections

# This field is for dynamic challenges.
